  Front-end developer at [Siyavula Education](http://siyavula.com).


  I build websites: back- to front-end. I turn an idea into a website that
  functions in the most efficient way possible through smart application design
  and programming. Occasionally, I advise on creative strategy, design graphics,
  and do light animation. When not wrangling code, I [think about civic
  engagement](/work/dandelion), and [arrange challenging music in a tasteful
  manner](/work/liquid-fridge). Many moons ago, I [organised creative
  swapmeets](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010) that combined academia, art and free
  culture.
